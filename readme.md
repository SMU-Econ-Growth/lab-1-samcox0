# Assignment Lab-1
# Instructions 

This repository contains the notebook for this week's lab. 

* Clone the current repository to your `EconGrowthUG/labs` directory on your computer. 
* Open the `.ipynb` notebook using **Jupyter notebook** (DO NOT open with or work in Jupyter Lab as it won't allow you to `validate` your work)
* Complete the exercises and analyses in the `.ipynb` notebook
* Commit your work (*Hint*: commit everytime you have done some serious editing and writing)
* Push the changes to Github. 

We will pull the completed assignment after the deadline.

Once grading is complete, we will push the results to a file called `feedback.html`. You will need to pull the changes to your local copy and open this file in a browser to view (because GitHub will not render html files).
